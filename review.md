# Activity 2 Marking Rubric  83/100

## Describe the SeaSpan "Visualization Challenge"  60/75

### What?  25/25

I would consider this dataset to be more of a table than a network.  There is definitely a network component but mostly it's tabular data.

### Why?  20/25
Doesn't show a clear understanding of the "why" actions or the needs of the Seaspan. For example, the capacity information is already apart of the data so it is not something that would be produce. Additionally Seaspan would need to Query the data to find potential scheduling issues.  

### How?  15/25

#### Assumptions  7/7

#### Preliminary Design  8/11
Your design is missing key information, such as ship capacity information, that are part of the needs of Seaspan.

#### Justification  0/7
No justification provided for your design decisions.   How does your design help the client accomplish the "why" tasks you've identified?

## Using The Design Study Methodology  23/25

### Applying the Design Study Methodology  12.5/12.5

### Study Pitfalls  10.5/12.5
There are more important pitfalls that you should consider. For example, PF-7 is a valid concern that should be considered at this stage (more than PF-23)
