### What


### Why
Actions
* Analyze:
	* consume: discover where vessels currently are, and the departure and arrival times. 
	* present: the design will be used to communicate information that is already know to the user. For example, the departure and arrival times. 
	* produce: use the information about how many passengers are on each vessel, and change schedules accordingly.

Targets
* Trends: Can notice that on specific days , or during specific hours of the day more people use the ferries. So for these times, they would need longer schedules for the day.
* Netwrok Data: berths = nodes, routes = paths betwenn nodes.
